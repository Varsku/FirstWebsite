<h1>HISTORY</h1>

<p>Everslave was founded in Lohja, Finland in late 2008 and got its first shape in early 2012. <br>
In July of that year, the band released their first demo, called 'Valediction'. <br>
The band played gigs mainly in their hometown or somewhere nearby and their second demo-CD <br>
'Hellride' came out in May 2013.

In November 2013 singer/guitarist Alpo and drummer Janne were asked to leave the band <br>
for various reasons. 1st of July 2014 the band announced that they've found a new vocalist, <br>
Tanja Härkönen.

Sami Rehmonen joined the band as their new drummer in January 2015.
Everslave finished recordings of its 3rd demo-EP 'I Am King' in June 2015.
Recordings took place at Sonic Pump Studios in Helsinki, Finland.
The EP contains four songs and it's the very first recording with our singer Tanja and drummer Sami.</p>
